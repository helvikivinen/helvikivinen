### I'm Helvi, your local library vtuber!

Hiii, I'm Helvi Kivinen! I'm a UI/UX lead with plenty of years of experiencing trying my best to make the internet as best as it can be. Online, I'm a study vtuber! I want to learn as much as I can, and help teach the things I learn to others (and learn a thing or two from them in return)!

Feel free to find me on twitch using the link down below, I mostly stream on Sundays but there's a chance to catch me at other times throughout the week too. I like to learn and teach just about every kind of topic, but for anything code related, you'll find what we worked on stored here in this github profile!
